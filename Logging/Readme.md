Logging Project
==========================

This project consists of the logic for sending basic log messages to any of the services we want to test out. I would not suggest copying and pasting this code directly into a production application as it was designed to provide examples for a blog post series and not to stand up to the rigors of real world use or long term maintenance. I cut several corners, left several pieces in a very rough state, and for the purposes of the post I didn't care about memory usage, error states, and so on.

Or put another way, if you choose to shoot yourself in the foot with this untested code, the author cannot be held responsible. If you have strong negative opinions about how the code was written, feel free to improve on it.
